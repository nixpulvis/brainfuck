complex.b
----------
Tests for several obscure problems. Should output an H.

dec.b
----------
Tries to decrement a value below 0.

hello.b
----------
Should print "Hello World!"

io.b
----------
This is for testing i/o; give it a return followed by an EOF. (Try it both
with file input--a file consisting only of one blank line--and with
keyboard input, i.e. hit return and then ctrl-d (Unix) or ctrl-z
(Windows).)
It should give two lines of output; the two lines should be identical, and
should be lined up one over the other. If that doesn't happen, ten is not
coming through as newline on output.
The content of the lines tells how input is being processed; each line
should be two uppercase letters.
Anything with O in it means newline is not coming through as ten on input.
LK means newline input is working fine, and EOF leaves the cell unchanged
(which I recommend).
LB means newline input is working fine, and EOF translates as 0.
LA means newline input is working fine, and EOF translates as -1.
Anything else is fairly unexpected.

left.b
----------
Should print 0, checking the left bound.

right.b
----------
Should print the length of the tape, checking the right bound.

size.b
----------
Goes to cell 30000 and reports from there with a #. (Verifies that the
array is big enough.)
